% Title 
\title{Opportunities and costs for AI integration in HART}
\author{Haoze Pang}
\maketitle

% Body
In 2022, ChatGPT became available to the general public.
This stirred great public interest in Ai. 
People were asking, "Will AI replace human? And if so, how?"
Perhaps 'replace' is not quite the right word, but certainly people's life will be (has been) substantially changed by AI.
This change projects itself into businesses and possibly, in the near future, the HART database.

A brief understanding of AI%
\footnote{%
AI is a catch-all phrase with many different schools (approaches). From know on, AI should be read as machine learning (one of the most popular schools.)
}
might help understand how it may transform HART \cite{DK86}.
Generally, there are three types of AIs: \emph{generative}, \emph{classification}, and \emph{regression}.
Generative AIs might be the most obvious one \cite{ImagePlayground}.
It is ChatGPT sitting on your browser, Copilot powering your office suite, and Apple's image playground \cite{DK89}.
